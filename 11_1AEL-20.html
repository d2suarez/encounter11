<h3>“The Dead Sea Scrolls have given us nearly the entire Hebrew Bible in manuscripts that are one thousand years older than those previously available. The Dead Sea Scrolls provide astonishing confirmation that the Old Testament Scripture we have today is virtually the same as that being read a few centuries before Christ. The accuracy of the transmission is remarkable!”</h3>
