<img src="images/encounter-11-1-apxi-meticulous-jewish-scribes.jpg" alt="Meticulous Jewish Scribes Before the invention of the printing press, every copy of every manuscript had to be made by hand — painstakingly page after page, line after line, word after word. Errors could be introduced if the copy was not made carefully, and so the Jews developed rules for preventing scribal errors in scrolls used in the synagogue.
1. Each day a scribe would make sure his reed pen was writing well by dipping it in ink and writing the name Amalek and then crossing it out. (For background on this practice, see Deuteronomy 25:19.)
2. All materials had to be made according to strict speci cations. Parchments had to be made from the skins of clean (kosher) animals and quills made from feathers of clean birds. The ink must be black and prepared according to scribal speci cations.
3. No word or even a letter could be written from memory. A scribe must have another scroll open before him and pronounce every word out loud before copying it.
4. Before writing the name of God, a scribe must reverently wipe his pen and say, “I am writing the name of God for the holiness of His name.”
5. Every letter had to have some space around it. If one letter touched another or if a letter was defective because of incorrect writing, a hole, a tear, or a smudge so that it could not be easily read, the scroll was invalidated.
6. Each column must have no fewer than forty-eight nor more than sixty lines and must be exactly like the manuscript being copied.
7. Within thirty days of completion, an editor would review the manuscript, counting every letter and every word as
a way of checking. The editor would also make sure that the middle word on each page of the copy was the same
as the middle words on the manuscript being copied.
8. Up to three mistakes on any page could be corrected within thirty days. If more mistakes were found or if mistakes were not  xed within thirty days, the entire manuscript had to be buried. If a single letter was added or a single letter left out, the manuscript had to be  xed or buried.
In case you were wondering, the Torah (Pentateuch) has 304,805 letters and 79,976 words in Hebrew.
