<p>How did our Bible come to be? Who wrote the Bible? Where is the first complete copy of the Bible?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are clouded because of incomplete records. We do know that the Bible is a collection of ancient writings which are the sacred Scriptures of the Christian religion. Part of the Bible, the Old Testament, is the sacred Scriptures of the Jews. How the Bible as we now know it grew and was handed on to us is told here briefly.</p>

<p><strong>THE MAKING OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p>The Ten Commandments and possibly some other laws were engraved on stone tablets (Exodus 19, 20, 31:18), but the earliest reference in the Bible to writing and a ‘book’ is in Exodus 17:14. When the Old Testament was written down in Hebrew, it was on scrolls of animal skin sewn together. Many scrolls were nearly a metre [about 3 feet] wide and 10 metres [about 33 feet] long. Each scroll usually contained one ‘book’, but if it was very long it was divided into two scrolls, as 1 and 2 Samuel. One of the rules, that the copyist should look at every individual letter before writing it down, resulted in very accurate copies so that often the older copies were destroyed after the new ones were finished.</p>
<p>The Hebrew Bible is arranged in three sections: the Law, which we know as the Pentateuch (Genesis to Deuteronomy); the Prophets, (the Former Prophets: Joshua, Judges, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, and the Latter Prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea to Malachi); and the Writings, (Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, 1 & 2 Chronicles).</p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST TRANSLATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</strong></p>
<p><em>The Septuagint, 280 BC</em></p>
<p>After the conquests of Alexander the Great, Greek culture spread rapidly throughout the Mediterranean countries, and Greek came to be the common language in this region. By the third century BC the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek for those Jews who lived outside of Palestine. In this form the Old Testament became widely known.</p>

<p>In Egypt strips of fibre were taken from stalks of the papyrus plant, laid at right angles to each other, pounded and treated till they adhered to one another and made a smooth surface. This was the ‘paper’ used by the scribes. In a drier climate than Egypt’s it became brittle. In a damper climate it rotted apart; so that while Egyptians and Greeks used papyrus for some centuries, other countries soon turned to vellum (the treated skin of sheep or goats) and other materials.</p>
<p><strong>THE MAKING OF THE NEW TESTAMENT,</strong><em> AD 40–150</em></p>
<p>While the disciples who had known Christ personally were still living, they told others about him in their letters and talks. Soon, however, his life story was written down. Although portions were perhaps  rst circulated in Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke, the Gospels were very soon written in Greek. Paul and the other apostles in the meantime wrote letters in Greek to their friends in the Mediterranean churches, and these were copied and handed from group to group.</p>
<p>By the end of the second century the books of the New Testament were collected in almost the same form as they appear today, and by the fourth century the Old and New Testament were used together.</p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST TRANSLATION OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p><em>The Vulgate Bible, AD 383–410</em></p>

<p>the day, was asked by Damasus, Bishop of Rome, to revise the existing texts and make a new translation. To do his work thoroughly, Jerome moved to Palestine, where he learnt Hebrew. Inspired by his surroundings, he first translated the whole Bible from Greek to Latin, and then made a fresh translation of the Old Testament from Hebrew. It took him twenty- ve years, but his translation lived through the Dark Ages as the Bible of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST ENGLISH TRANSLATION,</strong><em> AD 735</em></p>
<p>An old English legend tells of a Saxon cowherd, Caedmon, who was a lay brother in an abbey where the brothers were called upon to sing after the evening meal. Caedmon sang Bible stories in the Anglo-Saxon of his day. These paraphrases are thought to be the earliest form of the Bible in English.</p>
<p>About fifty years later the outstanding ecclesiastical scholar of early England, the Venerable Bede, translated the Lord’s Prayer into the Anglo-Saxon of his time and wrote commentaries on many books of the Bible. He became very much concerned that the common people should have some part of the Bible in their own tongue instead of Latin, so he started to translate the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>It is not certain that Bede, who died in 735, did complete the Gospel, for no copy of his work is left. But it marked the beginning of English translation, and there followed in the next two centuries Anglo- Saxon versions such as King Alfred’s Psalter and Aelfric’s Old Testament, which brought the Bible message in the language of the common people.</p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST ENGLISH BIBLE,</strong><em> 1383</em></p>
<p>Although he spent the early part of his life quietly in Oxford, John Wycliffe later became so active in political and religious controversies that he has been called ‘The Morning Star of the Reformation’. He organised a band of ‘poor priests’, much as St. Francis did, to live simply and give the message of Christ to the people in a way they could understand. These ‘poor priests’, or Lollards, as many called them, travelled all over England preaching in homes, at crossroads, in fields, and ministering to the spiritual longings of the people.</p>
<p>Wycliffe soon came to realise that they must have a Bible in English. How much of the translation he himself did is uncertain. With the aid of Nicholas de Hereford and some others, he completed an English Bible in</p>

<p>1383 based on the Latin Vulgate Bible. Immediately after Wycliffe’s death in 1384 a revision was made which was circulated through the country by the Lollards. The demand was immediate, although one copy cost the sum equivalent to the wages of a labourer working for 2000 days. Single pages were so eagerly sought that one man gave a load of hay for the few pages containing the Epistle of James. The church authorities, however, were not as pleased with his work as the people were, for they prohibited the reading of the Bible by anyone except the clergy.</p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST PRINTED BIBLE,</strong><em> 1456</em></p>
<p>It took Johannes Gutenberg, the  rst printer, a good many years to work out a satisfactory alloy of various metals, a practical mould for the letters, and suitable ink and paper. He had to borrow a great deal of money and consequently appeared in court often. The court records contain the only information we have on this important invention. Gutenberg printed several small Latin grammars and single sheets before he started on the Bible, but the Bible in Latin was the  rst book of any size to come from the press. This great undertaking probably occupied him from 1450 to 1456. His original press was destroyed in the wars that swept through Germany shortly after this Bible was printed.</p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST BIBLE OF THE REFORMATION,</strong><em> 1522–1534</em></p>
<p>Martin Luther’s attacks on the many evils in the church of his day brought to a head the movement that resulted in the development and growth of various Protestant denominations. There was no adequate German translation for the common people because early translations of the Bible into German were stiff, and in dialects of special regions in Germany. Luther, with all the facilities needed for successful translation— knowledge of the Bible, knowledge of Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and understanding of this people— nished a German translation of the New Testament in 1522 and of the whole Bible in 1534. His Bible translation was the first Western European translation that was based, not on the official Catholic Bible, the Latin Vulgate, but on the original Hebrew and Greek.</p>
<p>Changes in spelling and punctuation have been made, but it has remained the standard text of German Protestantism for four hundred years and it also had a considerable in uence on the following English translations.</p>

<p><strong>THE FIRST PRINTED NEW TESTAMENT IN ENGLISH,</strong><em> 1525</em></p>
<p>Seventy-five years after the invention of printing there was still no printed Bible in English—people read the Bible in Latin or not at all. After study at Oxford and Cambridge, William Tyndale was keenly aware of the new currents of thought and the need for an English Bible. In an argument with other churchmen he declared, “If God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough to know more of the Scriptures than thou doest.” So he went to London to get money and support for a new translation from the church or the King, but, as he wrote later, came to “understand at the last, not only that there was not room in my Lord of London’s palace to translate the New Testament, but also that there was no place to do it in all England.”</p>
<p>In 1524 Tyndale left his beloved England for Germany. The printing of his translation of the New Testament began in Cologne, but he was forced to flee up the Rhine to Worms where two editions of his New Testament were printed in 1525. Early the next year copies were smuggled into England in bags of grain, cloth, and furs, and immediately both the King and the Church prohibited its use. The Church authorities bought all they could find and burnt them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tyndale was working on the Old Testament with the financial support of some English merchants. In 1535 he was betrayed into the hands of his enemies and kept for sixteen months in Vilvorde Castle in Belgium. Tyndale begged his friends for a warm coat, for his Hebrew Bible, Grammar, and Dictionary, and for a candle that he might go on with his work, but he never completed it. He was tried as a heretic, and on October 6, 1536, near Brussels, was strangled and burnt. He died with the prayer on his lips, “Lord, open the King of England’s eyes.”</p>
<p>So accurate and so sure was his translation that scholars assert that it survived in one half of the Old Testament and in ninety per cent of the New Testament in all the versions that have followed.</p>
</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p><strong>THE FIRST PRINTED BIBLE IN ENGLISH,</strong><em> 1535</em></p>
<p>The work which William Tyndale had begun was finished by Miles Coverdale. Born like Wycliffe in Yorkshire in 1488, and educated at Cambridge, he was soon in touch with the ‘new learning’. He left England in 1528 and somewhere, probably in Germany, prepared a translation of the whole Bible using Tyndale’s translation of the New Testament and Pentateuch, and two Latin and two German versions. Thus it was not the direct translation of original texts, as Tyndale’s was, but it brought together in a wonderful whole the work of various great men. This first printed English Bible was published in either Zurich or Marburg, and circulated in England quietly but without much dif culty.</p>
<p>While his style lacked the vigour and originality of Tyndale, many of his expressions are still found in the King James Bible, particularly in the Old Testament.</p>
<p><strong>MATTHEW’S BIBLE,</strong><em> 1537</em></p>
<p>When Tyndale died he left behind a manuscript which fell into the hands of John Rogers, a friend of Tyndale, who was responsible for its publication in a whole Bible. Because it carried a dedication signed by a Thomas Matthew, it was called Matthew’s Bible. It contained Tyndale’s translation of Genesis to 2 Chronicles, Coverdale’s translation of the rest of the Old Testament, and Tyndale’s New Testament. The real signi cance of this Bible is that it collected and set up the basic text for many of our present English Bibles: for the Great Bible, the Bishop’s Bible, the King James Bible. Subsequent versions are essentially revisions of this text.</p>
<p><strong>THE GREAT BIBLE,</strong><em> 1539–1541</em></p>
<p>The notes and prefaces of both Coverdale’s and Matthew’s Bibles aroused so much argument that the king authorised Thomas Cromwell to supervise the revision process of a Bible that included no controversial material. Cromwell asked Coverdale to prepare the text.</p>
<p>Printers, machinery, type and paper were rushed to England, and there the book, called the Great Bible because of its size, was produced. The text was a revision of Matthew’s Bible made after further study of other texts.</p>

<p>Henry VIII issued a proclamation that this Bible should be read in the churches, and three or four copies were chained to stands in various parts of the larger churches. For a few years Bible reading was unopposed. Swiftly, however, reaction among the clergy set in, and Bible reading was prohibited to all but the nobility and a few others. Thousands of Bibles were mutilated and destroyed. When Edward VI came to the throne, Bibles were restored to the pulpits and the Great Bible was reprinted.</p>
<p><strong>THE RHEIMS-DOUAI BIBLE,</strong><em> 1582–1609</em></p>
<p>Faced with the vigourous activity of Protestant translators and the irrepressible demands by the people for an intelligible version, the Roman Catholic Church decided to issue an English version. The job was assigned to the scholars at the English seminary at Douai, France, who had left England when a Protestant Queen came to the throne. This seminary was moved temporarily to Rheims, and in 1582 the New Testament translation was issued. A lack of funds postponed publication of the Old Testament until 1609, when the seminary had returned to Douai; so the completed Bible goes by the name of the Rheims-Douai Bible.</p>
<p>It was the notes, rather than the text, that made the translation strongly Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>THE AUTHORISED VERSION OF KING JAMES,</strong> <em>1611</em></p>
<p>One of the problems that faced King James I when he came to the English throne in 1603 was that of conflicting religious parties. To straighten out the religious controversies, King James called the Hampton Court Conference in 1604. The Conference was signi cant because during one of the sessions, Dr John Reynolds, of Oxford, spokesman for the Puritan group, proposed a new translation or revision of the Bible that would have the approval of all religious groups. Since the king was personally interested, he supported the idea with enthusiasm and vigour, appointing  fty-four scholars to undertake the work.</p>
<p>Groups of committee members were assigned to work on certain sections of the Bible. Because of very explicit but judicious rules, of careful, conscientious interchange of work and of meticulous supervision after various parts were  finished, the version was harmonious in style, more accurate in translation than any previous version, and generally beautiful throughout.</p>
</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p>It took almost three years of concentrated work for the members to  nish the revision, and Bishop Bilson of Winchester and Miles Smith, later Dean of Gloucester, the  nal editors, went over it all for nine months after that. Although published without authorisation by King James or the Church, it immediately replaced the Bishop’s Bible and the Great Bible in the churches, and within  fty years had surpassed the Geneva Bible in use in the home.</p>
<p><strong>REVISED ENGLISH VERSIONS</strong></p>
<p>So incomparable was the text of the King James Bible that for almost two hundred and  fty years no other lasting versions appeared. However, during the nineteenth century, the discovery of more ancient manuscripts, the increased knowledge gained for better scholarship, and the discoveries made by archaeologists in the Middle East threw light on certain passages in the King James Bible. The English language itself had changed during the years. In 1870 the Bishop of Winchester, at a convention of the Church of England, proposed that a new revision be made, and a committee was appointed representing various denominations. Shortly afterwards, American scholars were invited to participate in the work and documents were exchanged frequently between New York and London. In 1881 the New Testament was published. Four years later, in 1885, the complete Bible appeared. The American Revision Committee disagreed on some words and phrases, their preferences being printed in an appendix; so in 1901 the American Standard Revised Version, with these and other changes in the text, was published.</p>
<p>If, as the historian Green once wrote, the Bible made the English people “the people of the Book”, later revisions have carried on that tradition with incalculable effect on the history of the world during the past 300 years. Its phrases are everywhere in our daily speech, in our historical documents, and in our literature. The Bible has inspired leaders in all walks of life throughout the whole world. Hundreds of men and women have risked death and suffered hardships to carry its message to the far corners of the earth, though they have had to master foreign tongues in order to express its message. The Book that began in the tiny country of Palestine has gone around the world.</p>

<h3>Twentieth Century Translations of the Bible</h3>
<p>The beginning of this century saw the upsurge of new interest in Biblical studies, a greater knowledge of the original languages of the Bible and the cultural patterns of the people of the Old and New Testaments. Then in 1947 came the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran near the Dead Sea, 1000 years older than the earliest existing Hebrew manuscripts.</p>
<p>Another factor stimulating the translation of new versions is the demand by churches or groups of churches, also the man and woman in the street, for God’s Word in the language of their day. Some authorities affirm that because all languages are a ‘living thing’ no major version should go for more than fifty years without a thorough revision.</p>
<p>To bring the language style to that of current use was one of the objectives of the translators of the King James Bible in 1611. It was, in fact, the seventh revision since Wycliffe’s Bible of 1382. So Bible revision is not just a 20th century phenomenon. Since 1611 there have been nearly 40 different English versions of the whole Bible, approaching 100 additional translations of the New Testament and over 150 published English translations of one book or more of the New Testament. For the purpose of this booklet it is not practicable to enumerate all these versions of the Bible and the New Testament.</p>
<p>The most significant English publications since 1950 include:</p>

<p>First published by the National Council of Churches in the USA, this version did not claim to be a fresh translation but a revision of the King James, the English Revised, and the American Standard versions. The New RSV is an up-to-date, readable revision of the earlier text, the work of an interdenominational team of scholars headed by New Testament textual authority Bruce M. Metzger.</p>

<p>Many regard Phillips’ “Letters to Young Churches” (1947) as the first translation to use modern functional equivalence principles. His desire was to communicate appealingly to the modern reader rather than to make a literal translation. The 1970 edition is such a full revision of his earlier work, produced from the latest and best Greek text, that Phillips refers to it as a new translation.</p>
<p><strong>NEW AMERICAN STANDARD BIBLE</strong><em> 1963</em></p>
<p>The name given to this version would suggest that it is a revision of the American Standard Version.</p>

The result was a text in English of a high literary level.

<p><strong>GOOD NEWS BIBLE</strong><em> 1976</em></p>
<p>This version is also known as Today’s English Version. It was sponsored and was first published by the American Bible Society, and has been widely distributed by many Bible Societies throughout the English-speaking world. As a distinctly new translation it does not conform to traditional vocabulary or style, but seeks to express the meaning of the original texts in words and forms accepted as standard by people everywhere who use English as a means of communication. The translation was produced by a panel under the leadership of Robert G. Bratcher. Unlike other versions there has been a policy of continual revision of the GNB, with changes being made in each successive new edition. In 1988 the Bible Society in Australia released an Australian edition, incorporating certain changes re ecting the Australian dialect of English.</p>
<p><strong>NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION</strong><em> 1978, 2011</em></p>
<p>A completely new translation by an international team of scholars, this version is intended to have clarity and literary quality, and so to prove “suitable for public and private reading, teaching, preaching, memorising and liturgical use”. But the controlling committee also sought to preserve some measure of continuity with the long tradition of translating the Scriptures into English, and the NIV thus retains wordings which are the same as, or similar to, the earlier versions on many passages.</p>

<p>The New Living Translation was first published in 1996. It quickly became one of the most popular Bible translations in the English-speaking world. While the NLT’s in uence was rapidly growing, the Bible Translation Committee determined that an additional investment in scholarly review and text re nement could make it even better. So shortly after its initial publication, the committee began an eight-year process with the purpose of increasing the level of the NLT’s precision without sacri cing its easy-to-understand quality. This second-generation text was completed in 2004 and has been updated again in 2015.</p>
<p>A large team of scholars were dedicated to the book- by-book translation work, under strict supervision and editing protocols. By choosing a team of quali ed scholars and skilled stylists and by setting up a process that allowed their interaction throughout the process, the NLT has been re ned to preserve the essential formal elements of the original biblical texts, while also creating a clear, understandable English text. This translation is particularly beautiful when read aloud.</p>

<p><strong>THE MESSAGE BY EUGENE PETERSON</strong><em> 1991–2000s</em></p>
<p>Some people like to read the Bible in Elizabethan English. Others want to read a version that gives a close word-for-word correspondence between the original languages and English. Eugene Peterson recognised that the original sentence structure is very different from that of contemporary English. He decided to strive for the spirit of the original manuscripts—to express the rhythm of the voices, the  avour of the idiomatic expressions, the subtle connotations of meaning that are often lost in English translations.</p>
<p>The goal of The Message is to engage people in the reading process and help them understand what they read. This is not a study Bible, but rather “a reading Bible.” The verse numbers, which are not in the original documents, have been left out of the print version to facilitate easy and enjoyable reading. The original books of the Bible were not written in formal language. The Message tries to recapture the Word in the words we use today.]</p>
