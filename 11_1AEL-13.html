<h3>Either a person is inspired by God or they’re not. When someone is inspired (i.e., a prophet), they communicate God’s message in a trustworthy way. This is a horizontal work (inspired human to another human). In contrast, illumination is when God reveals a correct understanding of something to a human who is in a right relationship with Him. It’s a gift from God to any Christian believer, to help us understand the Bible and what it means. It is not equal to inspiration, as its focus is on understanding Bible truth rather than on revealing truth.</h3>

<h3>Seventh-day Adventist fundamental belief number 1 is the first fundamental belief because all other beliefs are founded on this—the centrality of the Bible.

<h3><strong>The Holy Scriptures:</strong></h3>
<h4>The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of God, given by divine inspiration. The inspired authors spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to humanity the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the supreme, authoritative, and the infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the test of experience, the de nitive revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God’s acts in history. (Ps. 119:105; Prov. 30:5, 6; Isa. 8:20; John 17:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 4:12; 2 Peter 1:20, 21.)</h4>

<h3>It is incredible that Moses wrote his five books more than a thousand years before Jesus was born, and John wrote his books about ad 90 (about sixty years after Christ’s death)—yet they are still consistent and cohesive, despite the authors’ different life experiences and time periods. While the words in these books are different, their messages of God’s love and His plan to save us are the same.</h3>
<h3>Indeed, the Bible shows us a clear picture of God; it is an unchanging, infallible authority of life; it is a personal record of God’s involvement in this earth’s history and our lives today; it is the only real basis for truth in our unchanging world. Believing this isn’t always popular—but when you consider not only what is in the Bible but how it was put together and its endurance throughout history, it is an incredible book.</h3>
