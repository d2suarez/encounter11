<h2 align="center">1628: JOHN BUNYAN</h2>
<ul><h4>
<li>John Bunyan was born about September 1628. He was christened in the abbey church at Elstow on November 30, 1628. His parents, although very poor, sent John to school to learn to read and write. By the age of 9 or 10 he was living a reckless life with habitual cursing and swearing, lying, and blasphemy.</li>
<p></p>
<li>In 1649 Bunyan married and moved to the cottage at Elstow—he worked as a tinker. His wife’s name is unknown, but some think it may have been Mary—the name of their first daughter.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Bunyan was under Gifford’s ministry from 1651, but it was not until 1653 that he became part of the Bedford Congregation. He began to read Paul’s Epistles more extensively and cried to God to know the truth. He was baptized in 1653 in the River Ouse—probably at night. Bunyan began preaching about 1655. He was converted and baptized and began to preach during of Oliver Cromwell’s leadership, 1653-1658.</li>
<p></p>
<li>As his knowledge of the Bible increased, he commenced itinerant preaching. A number of churches in five counties from around Bedford claim that their foundation was due to Bunyan’s preaching.</li>
<p></p>
<li>With his great burden for the salvation of men and women, the Bedford church appointed him a deacon in 1657.</li>
<p></p>
<li>His wife died in childbirth in 1658. For the welfare of his family including his blind daughter Mary, Bunyan decided he needed to remarry, and he wed Elizabeth early in 1659.</li>
<p></p>
<li>With the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the magistrates began to enforce Anglicanism, which placed enormous pressure on the Puritans and the Independent church at Bedford.</li>
<p></p>
<li>In November 1660, Bunyan was scheduled to preach at Lower Samsell near Harlington. As he arrived he was told of a warrant for his arrest, but he continued. Almost before the first prayer was over he was arrested and sent to the county gaol in Bedford. Bunyan’s family, who lived just a few minutes away from the gaol in St. Cuthbert’s Street, felt the pressure.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Bunyan was then arraigned in the Chapel of Herne at the County Quarter Sessions in January 1661. He was charged that he “hath devilishly and perniciously abstained from coming to church to hear Divine service, and is a common upholder of several unlawful meetings and conventicles.” He was sentenced to three month’s imprisonment with the following—”If you do not submit to go to church to hear divine service, and leave your preaching you must be banished from the realm.” Bunyan replied respectfully to the judge, “Sir, as to this matter, I am at a point with you; for if I am out of prison today, I will preach the gospel again tomorrow by the help of God.” He said he would stay in gaol “till moss grow on his eyelids rather than fail to do what God commended.”</li>
<p></p>
<li>Later he wrote of Sir John Kelynge as Lord Hate-good of Vanity Fair in his book The Pilgrim’s Progress.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The gaolers later permitted some favors. He was allowed his Bible and his concordance. It was at this time that Mary, his blind daughter, would take him soup in an earthenware jug now in the museum. At this time he was sometimes released for preaching or attending church, then returned to prison.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Bunyan remained in prison until 1672. From prison he wrote Pro table Meditations and then Christian Behavior. This was followed by The Holy City. From 1667 to 1672 he wrote The Pilgrim’s Progress, published 1678. By 1692 more than 100,000 copies were in print in English alone! When Communist China printed Pilgrim’s Progress, the initial printing of 200,000 sold out in three days.</li>
<p></p>
<li>He rode on horseback in heavy rain from Reading to London, contracted a fever, and died August 31, 1688.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The next year 1689, the Act of Toleration gave dissenters and nonconformists the right to worship and preach.</li>
