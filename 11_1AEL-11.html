<h4>The writers of the Bible received God’s messages in different ways: Moses met God on Mount Sinai (and God gave him a stone with the Ten Commandments on them); Daniel had dreams; Samuel heard God’s voice speaking; Ezekiel had visions (like a dream while you’re awake); and many other authors received God’s messages through their thoughts. Despite how they received the messages, God made sure the words in the books were true and showed a clear picture of Him.</h4>
<h4>The Bible helps us to know God without actually seeing Him face-to-face. The Bible can speak to our every question, calm our every worry, reflect our greatest joy, and draw us to the heart of God. The Bible is a gift from God, but what does this actually mean? Inspiration can mean different things to different people.</h4>

<h3>“Without a correct understanding of biblical revelation-inspiration, one stands on unstable ground, vulnerable to misinterpreting divine truth.”</h3>
