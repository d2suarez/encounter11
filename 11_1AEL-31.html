<h2 align="center">Inconsistencies in the Bible</h2>

<h3>If you have questions about supposed inconsistencies within the Bible, explore the following Bible passages:<h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>Matthew 1:17 (28 generations from David to Jesus); Luke 3:23–38 (43 generations). One is the genealogy of Joseph, the other of Mary.</h4></li>
<li><h4>Matthew 8:28–33 (Two demoniacs are healed); Mark 5:2–16 and Luke 8:26–36 (one demoniac is healed).</h4></li>
<li><h4>Matthew 26:7 and Mark 14:3 (oil is poured on Jesus’ head); Luke 7:38 and John 12:3 (oil is poured on His feet).</h4></li>

<h3 align="center">Do</h3>

<ol><h4>
<li>Two students must leave the classroom while the rest of the students think of a topic or event that both of the students will be familiar with (for example, recent movie, book, or school event).</li>
<li>Bring one of the two students back into the classroom and give the student 30 seconds to describe or summarize the topic the rest of the class chose.</li>
<li>Then invite the second student back into the classroom and have the second student describe the same topic. Discuss how both students, who were present at the same event, described the topic differently.</li>
</h4></ol>
<h4>Discuss again the models of inspiration (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LjXhvGUMSoVnwscEm9zHy8ROwMzRxpcLhSqJiteqB9w" target="blank">presentation</a>). These inconsistencies become real issues if you accept only the dictation method of inspiration. In contrast, the whole-person model of inspiration takes into account other factors and allows room for minor information mistakes while still keeping true to the spiritual integrity of the Bible. As we can see, some authors of the Bible wrote about some of the same events with a slightly different slant. The important thing is that the major events are all consistent (death, resurrection of Jesus, etc.).</h4>
