<h3>The canonization of Scripture became necessary so that the church had a standard to go from. How did they decide which books to include? The canonization of the Old Testament was well established by the Jews long before Jesus came to earth. The well-established body of literature was known as the “Scriptures,” and there was no dispute about its inspiration.</h3>
<h3>However, a “ruler” was needed for the New Testament (NT), and the decision was based largely on the following things that were the “community form of inspiration”:</h3>
<ol><h3>
<li>The NT books had a self-evidencing quality and internal evidence of authenticity.</li>
<li>The NT Scriptures were those that were already being used in Christian public worship and thus already had inherent authority.</li>
<li>The books had some direct ties to the apostles.</li>
</ol>
<h3>It is important to note that the NT is not an authoritative collection of books but a collection of authoritative books. This means that the church didn’t just put their stamp on the books to make them authoritative; the books spoke for themselves. The church pulled them together because not every Christian church had every single book.</h3>
