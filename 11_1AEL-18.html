<p>Pale smoke from the oil lamp curled to the ceiling and hung suspended in the corners of the small stone room. Simon Bar Gideon blinked hard, and wearily rubbed his tunic sleeve across his aching eyes. Leaning back against the wall, he gazed at the unconscious form of his seventeen-year- old brother, so still on the pallet beside him.</p>
<p>“Reuben,” he whispered sadly, reaching out to touch a nger to the blood-soaked bandages that covered the frail young man’s head. “So young—so young.”</p>
<p>The physician of the brotherhood only a short time before had predicted that the boy would not live through the night. Clucking his tongue in sad despair, he left Simon alone in his sorrowful vigil.</p>
<p>Simon leaned close to Reuben’s head and gently smoothed back a lock of dark brown hair from beneath the bandage.</p>
<p>“What of Mother?” he whispered quietly. She and his three sisters were still in Jerusalem, surrounded by the brutal Roman legions of Vespasian and Titus. “Can you not give me even one word of hope, Reuben?” he pleaded. “Did you come so far over the wilderness to die without a word concerning her fate?” He wiped a trickle of blood from Reuben’s temple, then stared at the dark red stain. Had the blood of those he loved already been spilled in the streets of Jerusalem by some Roman sword?</p>
<p>“Speak, little brother. Only one word. Do they still live?” He lay his lips next to Reuben’s ear, his question answered by the shallow breath of the beardless young man whose wounds spoke more dramatically than words. “Your blood is mine,” Simon said quietly. The tears stung his eyes. He took Reuben’s limp hands in his own and began to recite the Shema: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord . . .” His voice was joined by another, steadily chanting from the doorway behind him. As they recited the ancient invocation in unison, Reuben’s breathing became even more labored until at last the rattle of death lled his throat.</p>
<p>Simon bowed his head and pressed Reuben’s hands against his cheek. “When he was a baby, these</p>

<p>hands reached out to me,” he said, his voice ragged with pain. “He took his first step into my arms.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Simon,” said the voice, his tone lling the simple words with deep compassion.</p>
<p>“They must all be dead, all of them now,” Simon mourned. “And I deserted them. Instead of ghting, I turned away to this—a life of peace, of studying the Word of God. I would have done better to have died with the Zealots!” Bitter pain raged through his voice, and he clenched his sts.</p>
<p>“Jerusalem has fallen. You have a greater purpose for your life than to die of plague or famine behind those gates,” his companion comforted. “You are not nished yet.”</p>
<p>“What is the use?” Simon threw the words at him. “Who will know or care what we do here?”</p>
<p>“Jerusalem has fallen,” the voice said again. “What good would it have done to have numbered yourself among the starving and the dead? Even the wife of the high priest was driven to wander through the alleyways of the city in search of scraps. Those who stole out beyond the city gates after dark for roots were cruci ed by the hundreds each night. Every tree has been hewn down, all made into the crosses which line the roads into the city. And when they have served their evil purpose, they fuel the bonfires that burn the dead bodies of our people. Such a death is not noble, Simon. It is only death.”</p>
<p>“How do you know these things?” Simon asked, his eyes still fastened on Reuben’s blood-streaked face.</p>
<p>“Only an hour ago two Zealots stumbled into the compound. They escaped death once, but it will nd them soon enough, I think. They say legions are coming here.”</p>
<p>Simon sighed, nodded, then crossed Reuben’s hands on his chest. “Then I have urgent work to complete.” He drew a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. “Is everything lost then? Everyone dead?” </p>

<p>“They say Titus began his assault on the North Wall. By day he crashed battering rams against the fortifications. By night the Zealots struggled to repair the breaches, resting only after collapsing with exhaustion—or when death came. Two weeks ago the outer wall fell, then the second wall. And last week the third wall crumbled. When the legions swept through the streets of the city, the survivors retreated to the temple and continued to resist. For six days the battering rams echoed in the courtyards of the Holy Citadel, then it, too, was taken. The soldiers butchered—killed everyone they found alive. Some escaped. A few—like your brother, like the two men. But as they escaped, the smoke of the temple blackened the sky behind them.” He paused, then said gently, “I am sorry, Simon. Your family is dead. We will say Kaddish for them.”</p>
<p>“And when the Romans come here, who will say Kaddish when the last Jew is dead?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps God,” he answered slowly.</p>
<p>“Then we must preserve the words of His promises.” Simon wiped his eyes and stood. “And when the words are sealed, then we, too, may die in peace.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Simon. We have another way to ght against those who say there is no God in Zion. Though we all descend to the grave and Israel be empty, God still lives.”</p>
<p>Simon turned toward the speaker in the doorway, a kindly, gray-bearded old man. “Then I will return to my pen and fight my enemies with peace in my heart.”</p>
<p>Simon walked slowly across the dark, deserted courtyard to the now-empty writing room. He unlatched the door and opened it, looking around the long stonework area as though he were seeing it for the rst time. Two dozen scrolls lay neatly wrapped in linen on the wooden table at the far end of the room. Tomorrow they would receive a final coat of pitch before being sealed in the clay jars and hidden in the caves on the barren hillsides around Qumran. Only this scroll, the book of the prophet Isaiah, remained un nished. Wiping his hands on his robe, Simon crossed to the writing table and sat down, lovingly touching the new leather stretched out before him. How long, he wondered, before the eyes of man would read the words he so carefully copied from the worn and faded master scroll? In the dim light of the oil lamp, he strained to read the next line of the column: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings...”</p>

<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p>His own voice echoed hollowly against the stone walls of the room. An ache lled his heart as he remembered Reuben stumbling into the community only two days before. His feet had not been beautiful. Without sandals, they were bloody, lacerated to the bone.</p>
<p>“...that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of joy, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, thy God reigneth!”</p>
<p>The triumphant declaration seemed to mock him. There will be no salvation, no news of peace, thought Simon as he carefully dipped his pen in the inkwell and copied the words of the promise he had just read. Only the Romans reign in Zion now. The promise of Isaiah would have to wait for another age, another lifetime. Or would it ever come? He wondered fleetingly.</p>
<p>In a matter of days the legions would come here to the community and kill, burn, and destroy in the names of Titus and Vespasian. Only the sacred writings would be safe. The Word of God would sleep quietly in a cave until another time to come—who knew how long?—and men would hear the promises and see their ful lment.</p>
<p>Slowly, Simon reached out a trembling nger and reverently traced the words of the prophet. He did not fear his own death. But he did fear the re that would inevitably follow slaughter. The scrolls must be preserved! Help us, Yahweh! His silent cry reached out to the God of Abraham.</p>
<p>He drew a breath as the faces of his family crowded his memory. Surely the God of Israel would not forget His promise; surely He would remember Jerusalem!</p>
<p>Simon brushed away the tears with the back of his hand and once again pushed his pen into the ink. Every letter, every jot must be perfect. Nothing can be changed or deleted. The temple has been burned, he mourned. Were any of the Holy Scrolls saved, or do I, Simon bar Gideon hold the last of the word that promised a nation would live again where now there are only ashes?</p>
<p>The thought of the legion lled his mind. Only a few days’ march from where he now sat, someone was sharpening the sword that would end his life. Quick! I must do this carefully but quickly, he resolved as he dipped his pen. He and his compatriots would steal the nal victory from the Roman holocaust. Together, thought Simon, we will be Guardians of the Promise even as we die in silence.</p>
