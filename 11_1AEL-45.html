<h2 align="center">Codex Amiatinus</h2>
<h3>From what we have learned, one of the central themes of the Reformation was the endurance of the Bible and the need for the common people to have their own copy of the Bible in their own language to read for themselves.</h3>

<li>Do we take this for granted today?</li>
</h3></ul>
<h3>How difficult it would have been to live during the 14th to 16th centuries. As a mild example of tyranny, if you were a mother, the only language you could speak in England was Middle English. The Bible was only in Latin, so you couldn’t read it. If you taught your children the Lord’s Prayer, the golden rule, or the Ten Commandments in Middle English at this time, the church leadership from Rome would come, take your children, and burn you to death. Only elite boys could attend school (never girls, and never farm boys). There was a reason this time period was called the Dark Ages.</h3>
<ul><h3 class="discuss">
<li>Can you think of other challenges that people would have faced when living without their own Bibles?</li>
</h3></ul>

<h3>Look at the Codex Amiatinus (find it in - The Story of the Bible, p. 42), the earliest complete Latin Vulgate Bible, made before ad 716. It is considered by some to be the finest book in the world and is one of the most accurate copies of Jerome’s Latin translation. (Note: this is not the Reformer Jerome, but rather a Catholic priest who died in 420.) This was all that people had until certain individuals gave up so much (often their lives) so that people could read the Bible in their own, common language.</h3>

<li>How would you feel about not being able to read this is your own language, while being constantly told that this was the inspired Word of God?</li>
<li>What are some challenges that people may face today (in our country or elsewhere) as a result of converting to Christianity?</li>
</h3></ul>
<h3>As we have discovered, one of the central achievements of the Reformation was the translation of the Bible into the language of the common people. When Wycliffe died, three out of four Englishmen followed the Reformation because of his ministry in England (without any computers or a printing press). Amazing!</h3>
<h3><em>(Christianity became the official state religion, so very soon every person in England was technically a “Christian.”)</em></h3>
