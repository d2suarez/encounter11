<p>Theologians generally say there are two kinds of revelation: general revelation and special revelation. General revelation refers to the manifestation of God through nature, history, and human experience; it is accessible to all people at all times and in all places (see, e.g., Daniel 2:21; Rom. 2:11–16; Acts 14:16, 17). Psalm 19:1, 2, for example, tells us that the created order speaks about God: “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge” (NIV). The message of this particular manifestation of God, however, is general and inexact rather than speci c and detailed.</p>
<p>Special revelation is “God’s manifestation of Himself to particular persons at de nite times and places, enabling those persons to enter into a redemptive relationship with him.” Because human beings lost the direct communication they had with God before the fall into sin (Gen. 2:17; 3:24), they needed more than general revelation because of their spiritual and moral limitations (1 Cor. 2:14). Through special revelation, God addressed human beings in their sinful state and disclosed speci c truths about Himself, His character, and His purposes (Deut. 29:29; Heb. 1:1, 2). The Bible provides the record of this special revelation to the human race.</p>
<p>...Special revelation is thus a disclosure of speci c knowledge about God that human beings can’t obtain on their own. . . .</p>
<p>...The content of the Bible has come through special revelation. As recorded in Genesis 3:15, immediately after Adam and Eve fall into sin, God announced the goal of all future divine revelations: the person and mission of Jesus Christ. He would be the divine content of this special revelation, and God availed Himself of every means to communicate to human beings.</p>
<p>In attempting to explain the way God communicated His message in ancient times, theologians have used the term modalities to describe the different forms or manners in which God manifested Himself and His will to the world. These modalities have been classified into the following categories:</p>
</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="40%" valign="top">
<ol>
<li><p>Theophanies (visible manifestations or appearances of God): to Abraham (Gen. 17:1, 22; 18:1); to Isaac (Gen. 26:2); to Jacob (Gen. 32:30); to Moses (Exodus 33:11); and to Gideon (Judges 6:12, 14–18).</p></li>
<li><p>Dreams and visions (Num. 12:6; Dan. 2:19, 28; 7:1; 10:8; Matt. 1:20; 2:13).</p></li>	
<li><p>Angels (Gen. 32:1; Dan. 10:11, 12; Luke 2:8–14; Acts 8:26; Heb. 1:14).</p></li>
<li><p>Casting of lots (Num. 26:55, 56; 1 Sam. 14:41; Acts 1:21–26). This modality was used only in a spiritual context, however; never as magic (Prov. 16:33).</p></li>
<li><p>Urim and Thummim (stones on the high priests’ breastplate): (Exod. 28:30; Num. 27:21; 1 Sam. 28:6).</p></li>
<li><p>Divine speech: God’s warning about the Flood (Gen. 6:13); promises to Abraham (Gen. 12:1–4); giving of the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20:1–17); instructions on the tabernacle (Exod. 25–27). The introductory formula “Thus says the Lord” appears literally hundreds of times in the Old Testament.</p></li>
<li><p>Miracles and signs: the Flood (Gen. 6–8); the plagues on Egypt (Exod. 7–12); Israel’s passage through the sea (Exod. 14:13–31).</p></li>
<li><p>The ultimate and de nite modality of God’s special revelation: the life, teachings, miracles, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and the rest of the New Testament as the inspired apostolic interpretation of Jesus Christ).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All of these modalities were divine acts or vertical events in which God revealed information about Himself and His will to specially chosen human beings, the prophets.</p>

<h4>INSPIRATION</h4>
<p>While revelation was a vertical event in which God communicated truth to human recipient(s), inspiration was the “relaying of that truth from the rst recipient(s) of it to another person, whether then or later.” Inspiration was thus a horizontal process that preserved and continued the original revelation. This process involved both oral proclamation and the writing of Scripture. The prophetic oracles in the Bible, for example, were essentially delivered orally before being put into writing (e.g., Isa. 7:3, 4; 39:5–8; Jer. 7:2, 33:6). The same is true of Jesus’ teaching (e.g., Matt. 5–7). The Scriptures, however, were the “culmination of revelation and its primary product,” the “deposit of divine truth for the doctrinal, moral and spiritual welfare of God’s people.” In this sense, Scripture is itself revelation and the nal modality of special revelation....<p>
<p>...Peter emphasized that human beings were the writers of Scripture: “For prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Peter 1:21, NKJV). Yet, these humans were “moved by the Holy Spirit.” The word Peter uses here for “moved” is pheromenol, which suggests the idea of being carried along by the Holy Spirit. Hence, he underscores the fact that human beings wrote Scripture under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. None of it was the product of the “will of man.”</p>
<p>In light of this scriptural teaching, Professor Dederen proposed the following de nition of inspiration: “another divine act or divine initiative in which God enables a prophet to receive and to communicate the content of revelation in a trustworthy and authoritative way.” This “divine initiative” involved the communication and conservation of divine truth through inscripturation, the process of casting that truth in written form. Thus, Moses was told to put in writing for future generations what the Lord told him (Exod. 17:14; Deut. 31:9). Years later, shortly before his death, Joshua instructed Israel to “be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses” (Joshua 23:6, NKJV).</p>

<h4>THE VERTICAL-HORIZONTAL NATURE OF REVELATION-INSPIRATION</h4>
<p>Revelation and inspiration worked together in God’s plan of communicating His will to humankind. Revelation was the vertical work of God in disclosing divine truth (through dreams, visions, information) to the prophet. The movement was vertical—from God to humans. Inspiration was the horizontal work of God in which the prophets were enabled to communicate the content of revelation, a trustworthy and reliable way (through oral proclamation and “inscripturation”—the writing of what became Scriptures) to the intended audience. The movement was horizontal— from inspired human to other humans. The prophet was the human agent who connected revelation-inspiration. . . .
<h4>ILLUMINATION</h4>
<p>One other divine act distinct from revelation-inspiration completes the process of God’s communication with humankind. It is the process of “illumination,” defined by Dederen as “a divine act by which God enables any person in a right relationship with Him to come to a correct understanding of that which has been revealed.” Illumination takes place when Christians sincerely ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit to understand Scripture.</p>
<p>Illumination should never be equated with revelation- inspiration. Sometimes Christians confuse the two. For instance, when a believer gains a life-changing insight into spiritual truth, he or she may claim it came through divine inspiration. And sometimes a person may be especially blessed by a sermon and then suggest that the preacher was divinely inspired like the prophets while preparing it. However, these are experiences of illumination and shouldn’t be confused with the authoritative revelation- inspiration experience of the prophets. Through the centuries, confusion regarding these processes has caused serious problems in Christian communities.</p>
<p>...In sum, illumination is a gift from God to aid us in understanding the biblical record of His original revelation to the human race. The Holy Spirit completes the process of God’s communication with human beings by making the original revelation personal to each reader of Scripture (John 14–16; Eph. 3:14–19; 1 Thess. 1:5). The Bible is the product of revelation-inspiration and the focal point of illumination, which are God’s methods of communicating His will to human beings. As a material shaped into a triangle is a very strong structural component, so a tightly connected combination of revelation, inspiration, and illumination makes a strong framework for the communication of God’s will.</p>
