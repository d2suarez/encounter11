<p><strong>WHAT IS THE BIBLE?</strong> (pp. 8–10)</p>
<p>“The Bible is a remarkable collection of books and letters. It was written in three languages by more than forty authors over a period of fteen hundred years. Some of the writers were kings, some were poets, one was a physician, and another was a tax collector. Some parts of the New Testament were written by uneducated fishermen. In spite of this diversity, the Bible has one central, consistent theme: God made us, He loves us in spite of our naturally rebellious attitude toward Him, and He wants to reconcile us to Himself.</p>
<p>“The Bible has two sections—the Old Testament and the New Testament. The word testament means a covenant or agreement between God and His people. The Old Testament tells the story of God’s relationship with His chosen people, the Jews [Hebrews], from the time of the creation of the world to about 400 BC. . . . The thirty-nine books that make up the Old Testament were recognized as Scripture by the Jews before the time of Christ and were translated into Greek in the third century BC, a translation called the Septuagint.</p>
<p>“The New Testament tells the story of Jesus and His followers. Twenty-one of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament are letters that the apostles wrote after the death of Christ. While the Old Testament covenant of law led to the conviction of sin, the New Testament covenant of grace leads to the forgiveness of sins....</p>
<p>“The word ‘Bible’ comes from the Latin word biblia and the Greek word biblos, which mean simply book. This word might have come to mean book because the port of Byblos in modern Lebanon was where Egyptians exported to Greece the papyrus on which books and scrolls were written.”</p>

<p><strong>WHICH PAPER?</strong> (pp. 10, 11)</p>
<p>“Papyrus, from which we get our word paper, was a tall reed plant that grew along the Nile River in Egypt, and was the same plant from which the basket was made that hid the infant Moses. . . . The manufacture of papyrus, the most important export of ancient Egypt, was controlled by the pharaohs and made by a carefully guarded process. . . Although we don’t know the Egyptian secret, we do know that papyrus can be made by cutting the inner parts of the stalks into long strips and soaking them in water long enough for decomposition to begin. The strips are then laid side by side and other strips placed on top at a right angle. The two layers are pressed and dried so that the strips adhere to each other. The papyrus sheet is then polished with a hard round object such as a stone or sea shell. The papyrus could be used either as sheets or connected in long strips and rolled around a stick to form a scroll....</p>
<p>“Parchment was also used in ancient Egypt, but it became popular in the second century BC in Pergamum, a city in what is now Turkey, when King Ptolemy of Egypt refused to export papyrus to King Eumenes of Pergamum. Without a source of papyrus, the people of Pergamum perfected the manufacture of parchment by scraping and stretching the skins of animals—usually goat, sheep, or sometimes calf— into thin, paper-like sheets. Parchment was more durable than papyrus and easier to manufacture, and so it eventually replaced papyrus. Vellum, usually made from calf skin [or lamb skin], is like parchment, but it is a  ner quality of leather.</p>
<p>“Pergamum also developed the codex, a form that eventually replaced the scroll. In a scroll, which could be as long as thirtyfive feet, words are written in</p>

<p>columns on one side of the papyrus or parchment and rolled around a stick, which made it inconvenient to find easily a particular passage. A codex had words written on both sides of sheets, which were then folded and bound together. Modern books are codices, but the term is used only for handwritten manuscripts produced before the invention of printing....”</p>
<p><strong>WHICH LANGUAGE?</strong> (pp. 11–13)</p>
<p>“The Bible was written in three languages. The Old Testament was written in Hebrew with small portions in Aramaic. The New Testament was written in Greek. Hebrew and Aramaic are Semitic languages, a term derived from the name of Noah’s oldest son, Shem. Arabic and Amharic (spoken in Egypt) are the two leading Semitic languages spoken today, with Hebrew and a number of other smaller Semitic languages also used in the Middle East and North Africa....</p>
<p>“Hebrew has twenty-two consonants and no vowels. . . . It is written from right to left and has only capital letters. . . .“The Greek and Hebrew alphabets were both derived from the Phoenician alphabet, but the Greeks added vowels, and so the alphabet has twenty-four letters. Greek contains both lower case and capital letters and, like English, is written from left to right.”</p>
<p><strong>WHERE ARE THE ORIGINAL BOOKS?</strong> (p. 14)</p>
<p>“We do not have the letters Paul actually wrote, the Gospel in Matthew’s handwriting, or any of what are called “original autographs” of the Bible. What we do have is more than 5,500 partial or complete ancient biblical manuscripts....</p>
<p>“This remarkable abundance of ancient manuscripts and the fact that the oldest surviving New Testament manuscripts date to within seventy to 170 years from when they were  rst written makes the New Testament unique among ancient texts. For instance, the earliest existing manuscript of the writing of</p>

<p>Virgil was copied 350 years after his death and it is the closest manuscript to the date of any author other than biblical writers. The earliest manuscripts of works by Aristotle and Sophocles were copies more than one thousand years after their authors’ deaths. . . . The Bible is the only ancient writing with existing manuscripts in the thousands.</p>
<p>“Of course, there are so many manuscripts because the Bible is not just another book. It is the Word of God to two of the world’s great faiths— Judaism and Christianity. No one ever gave his life to translate and preserve the writings of Virgil or Homer. But many have dedicated their lives to the translation and preservation of the Bible.”</p>
<p><strong>THE OLD TESTAMENT</strong> (p. 18)</p>
<p>“The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books believed to be inspired by God and written by numerous writers over the course of more than one thousand years. It includes historical accounts of the nation of Israel, poetry of the psalms, and prophetic proclamations to obey God. The English Bible groups the Old Testament into four sections: the Pentateuch (five books, Genesis to Deuteronomy), History (twelve books, Joshua to Esther), Poetry and Wisdom (five books, Job to the Song of Solomon) and the Prophets (seventeen books, Isaiah to Malachi). The Jews organized the same Scripture into twenty-two or twenty-four books in three divisions: the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. The difference is the arrangement. The English Bible, for instance, has twelve separate books written by the ‘minor prophets,’ whereas the Hebrew Scriptures puts them all in a single book.”</p>
<p><strong>WHAT’S THE OLD TESTAMENT ABOUT?</strong> (pp. 18–20)</p>
<p>“The first five books, the Pentateuch, tell the story of God’s creation of the world, the first man and woman’s fall from God’s favor in the garden of Eden, the Flood, the call of Abraham, and the</p>

<p>history of the descendants of Abraham’s grandson Jacob—whose name was changed by God to Israel—until the Jewish people became a nation in Egypt and escaped under the leadership of Moses [and guidance of God]. The Pentateuch tells of God’s giving the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai, the establishment of the Mosaic covenant [the agreement between God and His people], and the development of a system of worship in the tabernacle.</p>
<p>“The twelve books of history continue the story begun in the Pentateuch. The Jewish nation entered Canaan, the land God promised to Abraham, and went through seven cycles. First they were in servitude to a foreign nation, then they cried out to God, God gave the people peace through the leadership of a judge, and then the next cycle began with a foreign nation again placing Israel in servitude. During the time of Samuel, the last judge, the people demanded a king, and so God anointed Saul, then David, and nally Solomon as kings. The reigns of both David and Solomon were the height of Israel’s glory, and after Solomon’s death in 931 BC, the nation divided into the northern kingdom, called Israel, and the southern kingdom, called Judah.</p>
<p>“None of the kings of the northern kingdom were godly men, and in 722 BC the Assyrians (who came from what is now roughly Iran and Iraq) captured the northern kingdom, took the people into captivity, and, for the most part, the Israelites never returned to the Promised Land. . . . But in 586 BC the Babylonians, who had become more powerful than the Assyrians, captured Judah and took the leading citizens into exile.</p>
<p>“The third section of the Old Testament is poetry and Wisdom Literature: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. Much of this part of the Bible is identified [or connected] with historical events. King David, for instance, wrote many of the psalms, and Solomon is the traditional author of most of the last three of these ve books. These Old Testament books all re ect the human heart and its encounter with God, with sin, and with the issues of life. We can</p>
</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p>identify closely with these because the human heart has not changed in the last three thousand years.</p>
<p>“The final section of the Old Testament consists of seventeen books written by men who communicated God’s message courageously. Some prophesied to the people in the northern kingdom of Israel; others to those in the southern kingdom of Judah. Eleven prophesied before the people to whom they spoke and were taken into captivity; Ezekiel and Daniel wrote during their own captivity in Babylon; Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi prophesied after they returned from exile. A tremendous variety exists in the personalities and writing styles of the prophets, but they tended to have four themes: (a) the prophets exposed the sinful practices of the people; (b) they called the people back to the moral, civil, and ceremonial law of God, reminding the people about the character of God and urging them to trust Him with all their hearts; (c) they warned of coming judgment; and (d) they anticipated [foretold] the coming Messiah. Malachi was the last book of the Old Testament to be written, between 433 and 420 BC.”</p>
<p><strong>THE APOCRYPHA (OTHER BOOKS NOT INCLUDED IN THE BIBLE)</strong> (p. 20)</p>
<p>“Between about 300 and 30 BC some writings were added to the Old Testament that collectively are called by Protestants and Jews the Apocrypha, a word meaning “hidden” or “secret things,” and by Catholics the deuteroncanonical books. These are historically and culturally interesting writings, and when the Old Testament was first translated into Greek, most of them were included. Some of the early church fathers accepted part or all of these writings as Scripture, but others, including Jerome, whose translation of the Bible into Latin was considered the most authoritative by the Roman Church, did not. One reason is that neither Jesus nor the apostles ever referred to any of these books. . . . The historic Protestant and Jewish position, however, is that they are not Scripture. [For the reasons for this, refer to “The Canon” below.]”</p>

<p><strong>THE SEPTUAGINT</strong> (pp. 20–22)</p>
<p>“The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, and as long as the Jews spoke Hebrew there was no need for translations. However, the Jewish people were in uenced by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Persians, and Romans, and by the beginning of the third century BC, knowledge of Hebrew was becoming lost, and with it the ability to read or understand the Word of God. As a result the Jews translated their Scriptures into Greek or Aramaic.</p>
<p>“The oldest and most important translation of the Old Testament, called the Septuagint, was in Greek and was begun in the third century BC in Alexandria, the capital of Egypt....</p>
<p>“The Septuagint is important because of its wide use and because it became an authoritative Greek- language source for two thousand years of translations of the Old Testament into other languages. Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the earliest known manuscripts of the Old Testament were not Hebrew, but copies of the Greek Septuagint. The Septuagint was the Scripture of the early Christian church, and when New Testament writers quoted the Old Testament, they usually quoted the Septuagint.”</p>
<p><strong>THE CANON</strong> (pp. 22, 23)</p>
<p>“Determining which writings constitute the Word of God and thus are part of Scripture is called identifying the “canon” of Scripture. Derived from the Greek word kanon, meaning “rule” or “standard of measure,” a canon is the accepted or of cial version of something. The canon of Scripture refers to those writings that are authoritative for faith and practice because they are divinely inspired.</p>
<p>“To be part of Scripture a book must be inspired by God....</p>
<p>“No one questioned that Moses spoke God’s words, and so the  ve books of the Pentateuch were</p>
</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p>accepted as Scripture long before other books of the Old Testament. In fact, the Samaritans say that only the Pentateuch is Scripture. . . . The Prophets were accepted next as canonical, and the Writings last. By the third century BC, when the Septuagint was translated, the books of the Old Testament as we know them today had been identi ed as Scripture. When the first-century historian Josephus wrote about Judaism in Against Apion, he reported that the Jews have ‘twenty-two books [corresponding to our thirty- nine in English], which contain the records of all the past times; which are justly believed to be divine.’</p>
<p>“...In about AD 100 a council of these Jewish leaders drew up a list of accepted books of Scripture, which were the same Old Testament books Josephus mentioned and the ones we have today. The Apocrypha was not included.”</p>
<p><strong>THE NEW TESTAMENT</strong> (pp. 28–32)</p>
<p>“The Old and New Testaments form one story. Jesus told the Jews that the Scriptures ‘testify of Me’ (John 5:39) and that Moses ‘wrote about Me.’ (John 5:45–46)</p>
<p>“The Old and New Testaments are also both organized in the same way. The first half of the Old Testament is history, telling the story of the Jewish people. The second half contains other writings—poetry, Wisdom Literature, and the writings of the prophets. Similarly the first half of the New Testament is history, recording the story of the life of Jesus of Nazareth and the early church. The second half contains letters written to churches and individuals, and the book of Revelation.”</p>
<p><strong>WHAT’S THE NEW TESTAMENT ABOUT?</strong> (pp. 29–32)</p>
<p>“The New Testament contains twenty-seven books and letters written by eight or nine writers in the second half of the first century. Each of the first four books tells of the birth, life, ministry, cruci xion, and resurrection of Jesus [not all of the first four tell about Jesus’ birth]. They are not exactly biographies of</p>

<p>Jesus, but each tells the same story from a different perspective and is written to a different audience. The four are called ‘gospels,’ a word that means ‘good news’ or ’good story’ in Old English.</p>
<p>“The first gospel to be written—probably in AD 64 or 65—was traditionally written by John Mark when he was in Rome with Peter and whom Peter refers to as ‘Mark my son.’ Because Mark wrote to Roman readers, he explained Jewish customs more often than the other gospel writers did. . . . Mark’s emphasis was on what Jesus did more than on what He said. Luke (AD 80–85) and Matthew (AD 85–90) wrote their gospels. . . . Many people who had actually seen the events recorded in the gospels were still alive when the three Synoptic Gospels were written [and could testify to their validity].</p>
<p>“Matthew, a tax collector, wrote his gospel to Jewish readers and went out of his way to show that Jesus was the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy. Early church fathers all say that Matthew wrote his gospel in Hebrew and then it was translated into Greek. Luke was a companion of Paul and a medical doctor and is the only Gentile author in the Bible. He presents Christ as the “Son of Man” and writes with particular precision to Gentiles....</p>
<p>“The fourth gospel was written by John between AD 90 and 100 and emphasizes the deity of Christ. John makes a point of saying that the ‘testimony’ of the ‘disciple who . . . wrote’ the book ‘is true’ and clearly states that the purpose in writing his gospel is ‘that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.’ (John 20:31)...</p>
<p>“Acts, the nal book of history in the New Testament, was written by Luke shortly after he wrote his gospel and contains the story of the early church as it was directed by the Holy Spirit. Acts tells of the ascension of Christ, the spread of the church, stories of new converts, disagreements among the leaders, the conversion of Paul the apostle, and Paul’s imprisonment and transportation to Rome.</p>
</td>

<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p>“The second half of the New Testament contains thirteen letters written by Paul, nine addressed to churches and four to individuals, and the letter to Hebrews, which has traditionally been ascribed to Paul. In addition, there is one letter written by James, probably the brother of Christ; two letters Peter wrote, probably from Rome; and three short letters written by John, traditionally the apostle John. Little is known with certainty of Jude, who wrote the short letter warning Christians of the heresy of Gnosticism, although he may have been the brother of Jesus. The last book is Revelation, the only book in the New Testament that is apocalyptic, a kind of literature marked by visions, symbolic language, and prophecy. Written by the apostle John just before AD 100 while he was imprisoned on the island of Patmos, Revelation encouraged the faith of Christians in seven cities in modern Turkey.</p>
<p>“...Today more than 5,500 partial or complete Greek New Testament manuscripts have been discovered and preserved. The most complete manuscripts, of course, contain not only the New Testament but the Old Testament as well, with the three oldest and most complete being Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. All three are from the fourth or  fifth centuries and contain both testaments or part of them.”</p>
<p><strong>[Note to Teacher: Show students life-size copies on page 30 of The Story of the Bible.]</strong></p>
<p>“The discovery of additional biblical manuscripts will continue, allowing scholars to learn more about the biblical text. ‘It is reassuring at the end,’ observed Frederic Kenyon, ‘to  nd that the general result of all these discoveries and all this study is to strengthen the proof of the authenticity of the Scriptures, and our conviction that we have in our hands, in substantial integrity, the veritable Word of God.’ ” (p. 34)</p>
