<h4>Before you read Love Under Fire (contemporary adaptation of The Great Controversy by Ellen G White), did you know that Satan tried to kill Ellen White while she was writing out the Great Controversy vision? You can read about this, below:</h4>

<h2>The Great Controversy Vision of 1858</h2>

<p>The weekend of March 13 and 14, 1858, Elder James White and his wife, Ellen G. White, attended meetings at Lovett’s Grove, near Bowling Green, Ohio. On Sunday afternoon, the fourteenth, a funeral service was conducted by James White in the schoolhouse where the Sabbath meetings had been held. Following her husband’s discourse, Mrs. White arose and began to speak words of comfort to the mourners. While thus speaking, she was taken off in vision, and for two hours, during which time the congregation remained in the building, the Lord through divine revelation opened up to her many matters of importance to the church. Of this she wrote:</p>
<p class="indent">In the vision at Lovett’s Grove, most of the matter which I had seen ten years before concerning the great controversy of the ages between Christ and Satan, was repeated, and I was instructed to write it out. I was shown that while I should have to contend with the powers of darkness, for Satan would make strong efforts to hinder me, yet I must put my trust in God, and angels would not leave me in the conflict.</p>

<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p>The day following, James and Ellen White began their homeward journey. On the train, they reviewed their recent experiences and discussed plans for writing out the vision, and for publishing that portion relating to the great controversy. This, it was decided, should be Mrs. White’s first work after reaching home.</p>
<p>Little did they realize the anger of Satan because of this revelation of his character and wiles, or the intensity of his determination to defeat the plans for the writing and publishing of the proposed book.</p>
<p>Arriving at Jackson, Michigan, en route to Battle Creek, they visited their old friends at the home of Daniel R. Palmer. At this time Mrs. White was in usual health, and the following experience, as given in her own words, came as a complete surprise:</p>
<p class="indent">As I was conversing with Sister Palmer, my tongue refused to utter what I wished to say, and seemed large and numb. A strange, cold sensation struck my heart, passed over my head, and down my right side. For a time I was insensible, but was aroused by the voice of earnest prayer. I tried to use my left limbs, but they were perfectly useless — Ibid.</p>
<p>As she realized that this was the third shock of paralysis that she had experienced, Mrs. White for a time lost hope of recovery; but in response to the continued earnest prayers of the brethren, her strength was partially restored and the next day she was able to continue the journey to her home.</p>

<p><strong>WRITING AND PUBLISHING THE VISION</strong></p>
<p>Although suffering intensely, Ellen White began to delineate the scenes of the great controversy as they had been revealed to her. Of this she wrote:</p>
<p class="indent">At first I could write but one page a day, and then rest three days; but as I progressed, my strength increased. The numbness in my head did not seem to becloud my mind, and before I closed that work [Spiritual Gifts, vol. 1] the effect of the shock had entirely left me.</p>

<p>As she was completing her work on the manuscript for the book in June, 1858, Mrs. White received light on her experience at the home of Brother Palmer, and of this she says:</p>
<p>I was shown in vision that in the sudden attack at Jackson, Satan intended to take my life, in order to hinder the work I was about to write; but angels of God were sent to my rescue.</p>
