<li>What is prophecy?</li>
<li>Do you know of any prophecies that have been fulfilled?</li>
</ul></h3>
<h3>The foretelling of future events is called prophecy (not prediction, which involves chance). Historians tell us of the past, journalists tell of of the present, but only God can accurately tell us what the future holds. God has done this repeatedly in the Bible.</h3>

<li>Do you know of any prophecies in the Bible?</li>
</ul></h3>
<h3>A number of Bible prophecies will be explored over the next few months (particularly in the next two units on Daniel and Revelation), but for now, share that a number of prophecies were made about Jesus before He came to this planet, although many were not understood until after Jesus’ death and resurrection. The amazing thing about such prophecies is that they show that God is in charge and knows the future—which He reveals to us in the Bible.</h3>
