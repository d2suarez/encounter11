<h3>The Bible claims that it is God’s inspired true word. It tells you that it will change your life, making clear the darkness in front of you. You may have experienced this in your life, and some of you may not have.</h3>

<h3>Sometimes it’s hard to know where and how to start reading the Bible. You might have grown up going to church and sat through Bible classes, and still you might not really know how to study it for yourself. There is a difference between reading and studying the Bible, and there are definitely ways you can bring the Bible into your everyday life and relationships.</h3>
