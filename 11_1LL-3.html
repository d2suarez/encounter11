<h2 align="center">BIBLE METAPHORS FROM THE BIBLE</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Hebrews 4:12: “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” (NKJV)</h3></li>
<h4><em>Note: All Roman swords were double-edged.</em></h4>
<li><h3>Ephesians 6:17: “And take ... the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” (NKJV)</li></h3>
<h4><em>Note: It is interesting to note that in the armor of Ephesians 6, the sword of the Spirit is the only offensive piece of equipment—everything else is defensive. We need to choose to use God’s Word in order for it to protect us from evil.</em></h4>
<li><h3>Isaiah 49:2: “ ‘And He has made my mouth like a sharp sword; / In the shadow of His hand He has hidden me.’ ”</h3></li>

<li><h3 class="discuss">How could the Bible be your “sword” today?</h3></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bible offers us “cutting” truth; it pierces straight to the heart and is truth for our lives and our existence. Sometimes the Bible can cut us too—it can pierce us when it identifies our falsehoods, lies, and unethical thoughts and actions and pushes us to “cut” these out of our lives.</h3>
