<h3>A lot happened in the Christian church between the time of Roman persecution through to the Reformation. There is not the time to explore all aspects. Here are some of the points to consider:</h3>
<ul><h4>
<li>Domitian demanded to be called “lord and god.” What impact did this have on Jews and Christians? (See page 16 of Christian History Made Easy.) by Timothy Paul Jones (Resource Kit) for additional research areas and information.</li>
&nbsp
<li>Why do you think Christianity grew during the years of persecution? (See pages 17–19 of Christian History Made Easy.)</li>
&nbsp
<li>Why was there such a shift in Christian ideology from the early Christian church to the 1400s (from humility and giving to the poor, to accumulating power and wealth)?</li>
&nbsp
<li>What were some of the councils that were convened in the early Christian church, and what issues did they work through? How much agreement was there from one generation to another?</li>
&nbsp
<li>What did Eusebius (Constantine’s personal historian and propagandist) have to say about the canonization of Scripture? Where are the books that were left out of the canon?</li>
&nbsp
<li>Who were some of the very early heretics of the Christian church. and why were they considered so (for example, Mani)?</li>
&nbsp
<li>What was the impact of the Islamic invasions of Egypt, Palestine, and Turkey on the Christian church? (Consider the power centers of Rome and Constantinople and what happened in 1066.)</li>
&nbsp
<li>What impact did the Renaissance have upon the Christian church?</li>
</ul></h4>
