<h3 class="indent">“Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.”</h3>
<h3 align="center">2 Timothy 3:12</h3>
<h3 class="indent">“In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,”</h3>

<h3>The stories explored in this unit reflect that the history of the Christian church shows how God has always chosen individuals who were steadfast to His truth and who had the Word of God in their hearts. Their actions saw lives changed and other people’s hearts turned to God. As God’s people stand for truth on the Bible alone at the end of time, persecution will come. Yet Jesus said, “ ‘But he who endures to the end shall be saved.’ ” (Matt. 24:13, NKJV)</h3>
