<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
</div>
<h3>For further information into archaeology that supports the validity of the Bible, invite students to select a topic to research (some examples are seen in the following discoveries) and informally add their insights to their status page:
<ul><h4>
<li>Moabite Stone—discovered in 1868 at Dibon, Jordan, confirming Moabite attacks on Israel as recorded in 2 Kings 1; 3.</li>
<li>The Lachish Letters—discovered in 1932–1938, 24 miles (about 38 kilometers) north of Beersheba, describing the attack of Nebuchadnezzar on Jerusalem in 586 bc.</li>
<li>Cyrus’s Cylinder—records Cyrus’s overthrow of Babylon and his subsequent deliverance of the Jewish captives.</li>
<li>The Rosetta Stone—discovered in 1799, in Egypt, by Napoleon’s scientists. The same text was written in three languages—hieroglyphics, demotic, and Greek. It unlocked the mystery of understanding hieroglyphics. Understanding hieroglyphics helps to confirm the authenticity of the Bible.</li>
<li>The Black Obelisk—a six-foot (two-meter) stone obelisk detailing the 31-year reign of Shalmanasser III of Assyria. It contains a panel detailing King Jehu of Israel offering submission and tribute to Shalmanasser and is the only pictorial evidence of an Israelite king found by archaeologists (so far).</li>
<li>Other Assyrian records—describe “Azriyau of Yaudi” as leading an army of united Canaanite peoples against Tiglath-Pileser III (King of Assyria) when he invaded. Many historians consider this king to be Azariah, king of Judah (792–740 bc), see 2 Kings 15. (Some English translations call him Uzziah).</li>
</ul></h4>

<h3>Note: There is other extrabiblical archaeological evidence of historic people, places, and/or events from the Bible. But we must be intellectually honest—while archaeology con rms the existence of people, places, and/or historical events, archaeology does not (and never will) replace the need for faith about the miraculous, mystical, and philosophical and/or theological stories and ideas expressed in the Bible.</h3>
