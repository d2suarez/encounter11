<h3>UNIT LEARNING INTENTION</h3>
<p class="indent">To identify how the Bible is trustworthy and enduring</h3>
<h3>THE QUESTION</h3>
<p class="indent">Is the Bible trustworthy and enduring?</p>
<h3>THE TRUTH</h3>
<p class="indent">The Bible is extraordinary in its claims, content, and consistency and has endured throughout history as God’s inspired Word.</p>
<h3>THE ISSUES</h3>
<p class="indent">The Bible’s claims, content, consistency; the role of prophecy; the Bible in history and speci cally the Reformation; persecution; the Bible’s role in our lives today.</p>
<h3>UNIT CONTEXT</h3>
<p class="indent">The Bible, as a collection of books written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit by many different people in different times in history, is incredibly uni ed and has stood the test of time and criticism. No other book has been so savaged, no other book has lasted so well, no other book has been so hated and loved all at the same time. One of the reasons for its survival could be the simple fact of its being just what it claims to be—the Word of God. This fact alone would explain exactly why it has survived as the flame of truth in our dark world.</p>
<p class="indent">This unit explores the Bible as the basis for what is valid and the endurance of the Bible throughout history as the Word of God. It reveals the Bible as the source of truth that can be trusted and explores ways in which it can impact our lives today.</p>
<h3>UNIT’S KEY TEXTS</h3>
<p class="indent"><strong>Psalm 119:104, 105(NKJV)</strong></p>
<p class="indent">“Through Your precepts I get understanding; Therefore I hate every false way. Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path.”</p>
