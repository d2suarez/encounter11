<h4>WHAT’S IN THE BIBLE?</h4>
<p>A bunch of rules on how to have a totally drab life? Boring saints doing good things? No! Ripping tales of the mistakes and adventures of real people, the dirty linen of royals and commoners, rich and poor, ugly and beautiful, musicians, prostitutes, slaves, hired killers, great leaders. Some stories are tragic (rape, mass-murder, divorce, betrayal, family breakdown1), some are hilarious (talking animals, fat king who is dif cult to murder, suffering bullies, travel in a whale’s belly2)—but all make you think. There are also books of law, song lyrics, dreams, and witty sayings. The Guinness Book of World Records admits the Bible is the only book that outsells it every year. Classic? It’s been the best seller since 1456, when it was the  rst book ever printed.</p>
<p>But don’t take our word for it. And don’t be put off by people who’ve never really read it but have an opinion. See for yourself. The real proof is when you  nd it speaking to you about your life. You could say something like, “God, if you’re up there and if this is Your Word to me, please let it make sense to me and give me understanding.”</p>

<h4>HOW TO READ THE BIBLE?</h4>
<p>You’ll see that there are two main sections in the Bible:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Old Testament</strong> (39 books)—from the creation of our world right through to just before Jesus was born. (All of the things that happened before Jesus came to our planet.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The New Testament</strong> (27 books)—about Jesus’ life and things that happened after He lived on our planet.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p>You will notice that each book has chapters (the large numbers throughout the book) and verses (the small numbers) throughout the text. If you are to look up Exodus 34:6 this would mean that Exodus is the book, 34 is the chapter, and 6 is the verse. (Look for the details in this order—book, chapter, verse.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before you read, always ask God to help you understand what the Bible says.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that the goal of reading the Bible isn’t to memorize a lot of facts. Look for advice from the Bible about how to live your life right now and how to grow into a relationship with God.</p></li>
<li><p>Think deeply about what you’ve just read. Ask God, “What is it You’re trying to tell me through this passage?” Then God uses the Holy Spirit to speak to people in different ways. Sometimes what you hear might make you feel uncomfortable or make you change the way you do things, but in the end, it will always work in your bene t.</p></li>

<h4>WHERE TO START READING?</h4>
<p>You could start reading in one of the following places:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A book of advice and witty two-liners from King Solomon the Wise. (See the book of Proverbs. Start at chapter 10.)</p></li>
<li><p>King David’s affair wrecks his family and his kingdom. (See 2 Samuel, chapters 11–18)</p></li>
<li><p>Joseph, a rich man’s favorite son, becomes a slave, survives, and then rises to prime minister by his wit, work, and principles. (See Genesis 37, then chapters 39–45.)</p></li>
<li><p>Esther, an orphan slave girl, becomes a queen and risks her life to save the Jews from a race killing—more than 2,000 years before Hitler. (See the book of Esther.)</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus heals a cheeky blind man. (See John 9.)</p></li>
<li><p>Samson’s big muscles, wobbly faith, dumb choices, tragic love, and bloody war record. (See Judges 13–16.)</p></li>
<li><p>A story of the greatest life ever—Jesus of Nazareth. (See Mark or John.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>WHO WROTE THE BIBLE?</h4>
<p>About 40 people—shepherds, kings, prophets, apostles—between 1500 bc and ad 96 (a period of 1,500 years) wrote the Bible.</p>
<p>But—they claim to have been inspired by God. One said, “All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.” (2 Tim. 3:16, NLT) This is more than the “inspiration” of a piece of music or art. It’s God speaking via dreams or visions, and prophets writing down the message in their own words. One said “ Above all, you must realize that no prophecy in Scripture ever came from the prophet’s own understanding,[a] 21 or from human initiative. No, those prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, and they spoke from God.” (2 Pet. 1:21, NLT) So the Bible is God’s ideas in human words. God in uenced the hearts and thoughts of human beings and helped them put into words what He wanted us to know.</p>

<h4>WHERE DID THE WRITERS GET THEIR MATERIAL?</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Dictation.</strong> Writers sometimes copied as God dictated, for example, “Moses wrote down everything the Lord had said.” (Exod. 24:4, NIRV) But usually they wrote in their own words.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eyewitnesses.</strong> Peter wrote, “For we were not making up clever stories when we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We saw his majestic splendor with our own eyes.” (2 Pet. 1:16, NLT) John wrote about Jesus’ life, “We saw it all happen—we’re eyewitnesses. . . . Now we’re telling you what we’ve seen and heard so that you can share in this life with us.” (1 John 1:1–3) Could they have remembered wrongly? Jesus promises them that “the Spirit will teach you everything and will remind you of what I said while I was with you.” (John 14:26, CEV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research.</strong> Luke wrote, “In my first book I told you, Theophilus, about everything Jesus began to do and teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving his chosen apostles further instructions through the Holy Spirit. 3 During the forty days after he suffered and died, he appeared to the apostles from time to time, and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. And he talked to them about the Kingdom of God.” (Acts 1:1–3, NLT)</p></li>
<h4>WHAT IS THE BIBLE FOR?</h4>
<p>Quite simply, to “save” humans and to get us into a relationship with God so that we can be with Him in heaven. One writer said, “The disciples saw Jesus do many other miraculous signs in addition to the ones recorded in this book. But these are written so that you may continue to believe[a] that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing in him you will have life by the power of his name..” (John 20:30–31, NLT) You can read it for entertainment and information, but most importantly, it is a message from God to you that will help build a relationship that can last forever. It’s a tool that God has given us to help us when we need a good idea or some solid advice when we encounter the challenging, frustrating, and confusing times of life. (“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work” 2 Timothy 3:16, 17 NIV)</p>

<h3>Five Bible Myths</h3>
<table width="90%">
<tr>
<td width="2.5%"></td>
<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p>There are some myths about the Bible:</p>
<p><strong>Myth 1:</strong> The Bible is unscienti c. Albert Einstein, Sir Isaac Newton, Blaise Pascal, Dr Isaac Asimov, and many less famous scientists all read and wrote about the Bible—and believed it! While it’s not a science textbook, it does ask questions that go deeper than science, such as Why do things make me sad? Do you love your partner? How can I  nd life after death?</p>
<p>Because of the Bible, the world makes more sense—otherwise our purpose in life and answers to our questions would be hard to find.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 2:</strong> The original Bible has been lost in translation. The fact is that we have many copies of Bible books in original languages—Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek— and scholars are learning more and more about those languages as more ancient documents are found and studied. Our translations are based on good scholarship.</p>
<p>There are more manuscripts (very old copies) to support the validity of the Bible than all other classical literature combined! At the moment, the Bible has been translated into more than 2,000 languages. But the most amazing thing is that despite all of the different authors and time periods of when it was written, it still tells a single unfolding story. This is the most amazing fact of all.</p>
<p><strong>Myths 3:</strong> The Bible has been changed. Actually, archaeologists have found 2,000-year-old manuscripts, and they are almost exactly the same as the versions we have today! Hundreds of ancient copies in different parts of the world are practically identical. (For instance, the Dead Sea Scrolls, found in 1947 by an Arab goat herder who was looking for a lost animal, contain large sections of the Old Testament that showed today’s version to be amazingly accurate.)</p>
<p>Ancient scribes would not want to change what they thought was the Word of God. They took painstaking accuracy to amazing extremes. But if one rebel scribe decided to change “Jesus walked on water” into “Jesus surfed”, one of many checks would  nd it and wouldn’t just blot out the mistake and start again, but would destroy the whole manuscript—which would have been weeks of work.</p>
<p>Even if editors back then missed his mistake, today’s textual critics would show that his copy was different from hundreds of others. For instance, in Mark chapter 5, different manuscripts say Jesus went to a region of “the Gerasenes,” “the Gergasenes,” or “the Gadarenes.” Big deal—and most variations in translations are about this serious!</p>

</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="40%" valign="top">
<p><strong>Myth 4:</strong> The writers wrote novels or lies. The major problem that people have surrounding this myth are the miracles in the Bible. How can people be healed and brought back to life or walk on water? I’ve never seen that! But shouldn’t we keep an open mind on whether a creative God might choose to interfere in the natural world now and then? Yep, it sounds unlikely, but no one can prove it’s impossible. I’d be interested to read eyewitness accounts from people who claimed to have seen the supernatural (such as some biblical authors)— especially if they were sane and weren’t making a dollar out of their story. And especially if large crowds of people said they’d seen the same thing.</p>
<p>Many of the Bible writers were threatened and even killed for what they wrote (e.g., for saying Jesus came back from the dead). And yet they stuck to their story. As well as this, many people throughout history have died horrible deaths rather than give up their belief in the Bible, while others have died horrible deaths just to get it into other people’s hands. No other book could motivate this kind of commitment (and also the commitment to kill others because of their belief in the Bible), which tells us that there must be something special inside its pages. No one has been able to stop this book. The Bible always triumphs.</p>
<p>“For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NIV)</p>
<p>Another reason we know the Bible is true is because of the predictions that were made that came true. (Isaiah 53—prophecies about Jesus’ birth, life, and death. Daniel 2—history record of the empires.)</p>
<p><strong>Myth 5:</strong> The Bible is sexist. The Bible was written in a sexist age—which makes it all the more radical when you read its stories of female prophets, judges, heads of state, business leaders, farm managers, and mothers. It promotes equality before God in Christ, between “Jew and Greek, slave and free, rich and poor, male and female.” (Galatians 3:28)</p>
<p>It’s encouraging to know that we have an instruction manual for life in the Bible. It gives us advice on everything you could ever need.</p>
