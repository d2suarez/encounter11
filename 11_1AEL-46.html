<h3>“The mark of all the evangelical reformers was that they were men totally committed to the authority of Scripture. It was their final test and source of all doctrine and it towered above princes, prelates and popes. In 1528 Tyndale wrote in his Parable of the Wicked Mammon, ‘Believe not every spirit suddenly, but judge them by the Word of God, which is the trial of all doctrine; and lasteth for ever’. Sola Scriptura, Scripture alone, was the watchword of the reformers. From this followed the doctrine of justification by faith in the merits of Christ alone. By a papal bull of 1343, Unigenitus (the Latin bulla referred to the pope’s lead seal), Clement VI asserted that Mary and the saints have been adding to the merits of Christ, and that this great reservoir of merit in heaven has been given to the Church to dispense to the faithful—at a price. The reformers rightly saw that such teaching found no support in Scripture and it savagely attacked the glory of the redemption gained by Christ on the cross. With such teaching the Church was bound to be corrupt; it could be nothing else. But how could the eyes of the common people be opened unless they could read the Scriptures for themselves? Thus the two fundamental doctrines of men like Tyndale and Luther—the absolute authority of Scripture, and salvation by faith in the death of Christ alone, led to an inevitable conclusion: the Scriptures must be translated. Lesser men might flinch from taking up the task in defiance of the pope and his councils. Erasmus admitted his own weakness in a letter to Richard Pace: ‘I follow the pope and the Emperor when they decide well, because it is pious to do so; I bear their bad decision, because it is safe to do so’. Such men could never change Rome, even if they wanted to. Tyndale was a different kind of man.”</h3>

<h3>When Tyndale completed his first translation into English of the New Testament, it was shipped to England. At the time, the laws of England prohibited any translation of the Bible except the official Latin Church translation. Here is a bit of background information as to what happened:</h3>
<h3>“During the spring of 1526 the merchant ships that traded between England and the continent began to deliver their precious cargo to the docks and warehouses of London. For the first time in the long history of the nation, a printed English New Testament was available for those who could afford to pay one shilling and eight pence* for an unbound copy or a shilling extra for a bound copy. The merchants were careful to conceal the contraband amongst more legitimate items for import and certainly the first copies to arrive reached friendly hands in safety. Although Tyndale’s name did not appear on this first edition, there was no difficulty in disposing of the copies and eager hands reached out for the precious book. It was not long before the New Testament had passed through the great cities and the two universities into the possession of even the humblest men and women: apprentices, tailors, founders, saddlers, weavers, bricklayers, servants, fishmongers; wherever a poor man or woman could be found able to read, a few would club together and buy a copy of the Scriptures. The price was relatively cheap, probably not more than half a week’s wages for a labourer, and the demand grew. Poor men would offer a load of hay for a New Testament.”</h3>
<p align="right">— Edwards, God’s Outlaw, p. 91</p>
<p>* Eight pence (each penny roughly equal to a cent in decimal currency) was about the amount a laborer earned in a day.</p>

<h3>“The late summer and autumn of 1531 provided a sad and ominous prelude to the coming year. Little Bilney was burnt at Norwich in August and Richard Bayfield died at the Smithfield stake in December. Two of Tyndale’s close friends and loyal workers were thus gone. Bayfield had acted as a courier and on at least three occasions conveyed large consignments of books and Testaments to England. In the same month of December a leather-seller named Tewkesbury died at Smithfield. Others recanted . . . a few, like George Constantine, gave in under torture and revealed valuable information regarding the involvement of certain ship’s masters in the contraband traffic, and the secret marks used to identify the bales and boxes that contained forbidden books and Bibles.</h3>
<h3>“Tyndale received the weekly reports of arrests, recantings and burnings with sorrow but never with recrimination towards those who broke under pressure. One of the greatest burdens upon the lonely exile must have been the knowledge that he had precipitated this cruel persecution by his translation and books and that many of those rotting in prison or dying in agony at the stake had willingly committed themselves to the great commission so close to his heart. The records reveal men in every station of life in conflict with the authorities for reading the English New Testament and other proscribed books: a French bookbinder, a Dutch printer, a priest, a weaver, servants, tailors, apprentices, leatherworkers, painters, and even a boy from Colchester who died after being thrown into prison by Thomas Moore, the lists, complete with names and details of the charges, are almost endless. Men of rank and learning were not spared either.”</h3>

<h3>The invention of Gutenburg’s printing press was a highly significant tool in spreading the truth of the Bible. Before then, only rich people could afford the small fragments of goat’s skin with short passages of English translations written by hand (usually on the theme of justification by faith).</h3>
