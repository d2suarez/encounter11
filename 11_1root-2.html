<h2 class="apxtitle">STUDENT ASSESSMENT</h2>
<h3>SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT OPTIONS:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Participate in a <strong>Night of the Notables</strong>, where you will <strong>assume the character of a key person in the Reformation</strong> and look and act like and answer questions about the life of that person. Key people include Huldrych Zwingli (Switzerland), John Wycliffe (England), Hugo Jan Huss (Czech), Jerome of Prague (Czech), Martin Luther (Germany), William Farel (France), John Calvin (France), Louis de Berquin (France), Menno Simons (Netherlands), Hans Tausen (Denmark), Olaf and Laurentius Petri (Sweden), William Tyndale (England), John Knox (Scotland), Charles Wesley (England). You may also choose to include others such as Johann Tetzel and the cardinal at the Council of Trent, and other historical figures from the papal side.</p>
<p>Create <strong>10 question</strong> cards for people to take who may want to engage in conversation. You should also be prepared to answer any personal questions that may arise from visitors on the character and in particular, on the role of the Bible at that time. Invite the school community (or simply parents of students in the class) to participate in this event.</p>
<li><p>Create a <strong>character profile</strong> on one of the characters mentioned in option number 1. <strong>Record facts, traits, properties, or qualities</strong> about your chosen Reformer. To summarize their learning, create a <strong>summary paragraph</strong> about how the individual contributed to the endurance of the Bible as well as a <strong>descriptive paragraph</strong> about the person’s life and what they contributed to the Reformation. Then decorate your character profiles using natural resources or other symbolic objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a <strong>short story</strong> from the <strong>perspective of one of the Reformers</strong>, focusing on the role of the Bible in the Reformer’s life.</p></li>
<li><p>Respond to the following questions as <strong>short answer responses</strong> during class time:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do you feel about the Reformers and others who literally gave their lives so that the Bible could be translated into the common languages?</p></li>
<li><p>What is so powerful about the Bible?</p></li>
<li><p>Why, do you think, were the church leaders so opposed to the Bible being translated into common languages?</p></li>
<li><p>Today, in what ways do we show we value the Bible?</p></li>
</ul>
<li><p>Identify and give examples of how the Bible has been “a lamp to your feet, and a light to your path,” recommending how it could benefit someone who doesn’t believe the Bible to be trustworthy and inspired.</p></li>
</ol>
