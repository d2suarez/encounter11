<h2>Our Story</h2>
<h3>As a class follow these steps to make an awesome story!</h3>
</div>
<h4>
<ol>
<li>As a class, create three fictional characters. </li>
<li>Write their names on the board.</li>
<li>Briefly discuss a context and title for the story you will write (such as “Camping at the Canyon” or “Snowboarding Turns Sour”). As a whole group, spend no more than two minutes as a class discussing the context.</li>
<li>Then each student individually and silently write a short “chapter” on the chosen story. Each “book chapter” should be about half a page long.</li>
<em>Alternatively, decide on a topic that you all know something about (for example, “Recycling” or "Grade 11 Camp”) and have students each write about the topic.</em>
<li>When complete:</li>
Each student will read their chapter and place it on the floor or a large table. Then elect two or three students who will lead the discussion as to what order the stories should be in. These elected student leaders will move the stories around and seek input from other students about this editing process with the goal of organizing them into a single book. (They are not able to rewrite anything, but simply organize what has already been created.)
</ol>
