&nbsp
<li>What made the Reformers so passionate about their cause that they were willing to die for it?</li>
&nbsp
<li>Why were the leaders of the Cathoic Church so opposed to people reading the Bible for themselves?</li>
&nbsp

<h3>There were also people in the Bible who suffered and were persecuted because of their faith in God. History tells us that Peter was crucified upside-down and that Paul was beheaded by Nero; Steven was stoned (Acts 7:54–60); James was killed with a sword (Acts 12:1–5); John the Baptist was beheaded (Matt. 14:10–12.)</h3>
<h3>A glance at Christian history shows centuries of persecution from the Jews and later the Romans. For the Christian believer, persecution was a way of life and in many cases the best form of evangelism (1 Pet. 3:15–17; 4:12–19). Eventually, persecution eased when Christians were placed in prominent offices or positions of influence. It does seem odd that the next form of persecution would come out the Church itself.</h3>
<h3>The inspired Word of God is so precious; therefore, Satan has tried to attack it in so many different ways throughout history.</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There were many pagans and heretics of other descriptions who were also persecuted once Christianity gained power. Some Christians were obsessed with martyrdom and worshiped martyrs.</p>
