<p class="indent"><em>(Maureen, Felicia, Bill, and Joe are huddled around a small portable stove. A pot of beans is cooking on it. Everyone looks bored and depressed. For a long moment, no one says a word. Finally . . .)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> Hey, those beans must be almost done.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(Joe gets up and stirs them, tries some, shakes his head. Sits down. Silence. Finally, Maureen can’t stand it anymore.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Maureen:</strong> (Jumping up) I can’t STAND it anymore! Is it always this boring?</p>
<p class="indent">This is a war zone! There has to be something more interesting than beans cooking!</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(Everyone looks at her flatly. Embarrassed, she sits down again. Silence.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> How about those beans?</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(Joe gets up and stirs them, tries some, nods, dishes some out, and passes around bowls. Finally, he sits down. Everybody eats in silence. Suddenly from offstage, a huge explosion and gunfire. Everybody looks around. Mail-Guy comes crawling on stage, ducking bullets, etc. He is dragging his mail bag behind him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong> Hey, it’s the mail guy! Mail-Guy: Mail person.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(There is a flurry of activity; everyone wants to help the mail get through. They drag Mail-Guy into the circle, talking excitedly. Everyone is crowding around, poking, prodding, and trying to get their mail.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> Anything for me?</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong> How about me?</p>
<p><strong>Mail-Guy:</strong> OK, now, everybody just sit down and take it easy! Let me catch my breath here!</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(All sit down but are on the edges of their seats, unable to restrain their enthusiasm)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mail-Guy:</strong> Boy, I almost thought I wasn’t going to make it this time. It’s rough out there! <em>(Nods of agreement. Mail-Guy pulls a packet of letters out of his bag.)</em> OK . . . Joe, here you go. <em>(Hands Joe two thin envelopes.)</em> Bill . . . <em>(Hands Bill one thin envelope.)</em> Oh, and here you go, Felicia. Be careful with that one—it’s heavy! <em>(Hands Felicia a huge envelope decorated with tender care. Maureen looks on expectantly.)</em> Well, that’s it. <em>(To Maureen)</em> Sorry, bud. Nothing for you again today, either. <em>(Maureen looks crestfallen.)</em> Well, I’ve got to be moving. So long! <em>(Everyone waves goodbye as Mail-Guy exits under heavy fire. All begin tearing into their mail except Felicia, who merely turns her envelope over again and again, examining it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Maureen:</strong> <em>(eagerly)</em> Well, what did you get? Bill?</p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> A letter from my best friend back home . . . Ed McMahon!</p>
<p class="indent">It says here I may have won a million dollars!</p>
<p><strong>Maureen:</strong><em>(Shakes head, turns to Joe. Felicia is watching the exchange with interest, letter in hand.)</em> What you got there, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong> Man, just the same old thing every time. I’m preapproved for a full line of credit, blah blah blah <em>(tosses envelope over shoulder)</em>. And I don’t want to become a member of the National Geographic Society. Doesn’t even have my name on the letter <em>(tosses it over shoulder, dejected)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Maureen:</strong> <em>(also saddened)</em> That’s too bad, Joe. What did you get Felicia? Looked like an awfully full envelope!</p>
<p><strong>Felicia:</strong> <em>(proudly holds out letter for all to admire)</em> A letter from Jay, my one true love back home. Look how he decorated the envelope and everything! <em>(Hands it to Maureen, who admires Jay’s handiwork and passes the letter on around the circle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Maureen:</strong> Hey, that’s really something! You’re a lucky girl. Wow. Someone at home who loves you and writes you letters.</p>
<p><strong>Felicia:</strong> Yep. Jay writes me all the time. <em>(Joe and Bill nod in agreement.)</em> I get at least one envelope every time the Mail Guy comes around. <em>(Takes envelope back and puts it in her pants pocket. Mail-Guy can shout “Mail Person!” from offstage at this point.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Maureen:</strong> <em>(stunned)</em> Wait! Aren’t you going to open it?</p> 
<p><strong>Felicia:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> Nah.</p>
<p><strong>Maureen:</strong> But don’t you want to know what it says?</p>
<p><strong>Felicia:</strong> <em>(matter of factly)</em> I do know what it says. I love you, I miss you, I hope you’re safe. Stuff like that. You know, your basic love letter.</p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> Yeah, Felicia never opens her letters from Jay. She must have close to a hundred of them in her backpack.</p>
<p><strong>Felicia:</strong> Now where did those beans get to?</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(Everyone but Maureen turns back to their beans. Bill is about to take another bite of beans when he glances up. Everyone suddenly goes into slow motion.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> <em>(points to the sky stage right)</em> INCOMING!!! <em>(At the warning, everyone, still in slow motion, dives for cover. During the confusion, Maureen makes an elaborate grab for the envelope tucked in Felicia’s back pocket and swipes it. After a moment, everyone returns to normal speed, reacting to the horrible shelling.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Felicia:</strong> Wow! That was a close one!</p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> Yeah! Remember last Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong> Phew!</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(Everyone freezes but Maureen, who steps forward and pulls out the stolen letter.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Maureen:</strong> <em>(Reading)</em>
<p class="indent">Dear Felicia,</p>
<p class="indent">I can’t understand why you’re not responding to my letters! Has something happened to you? Are you hurt? I miss you so much and long to know what is happening in your life. If I don’t hear from you soon, I fear I may abandon hope of ever seeing you again! I think of you every minute of every day.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(Maureen looks up)</em> Wow! This is good stuff! I wish I had someone who would write me like this . . . Hey! <em>(Looks around, a sly grin coming over her face. Places letter in her own pocket, takes out pen and paper, and begins writing.)</em></p>
<p class="indent">Dear Jay, you don’t know me, but I feel like I’ve known you forever . . .</p>
<p class="indent"><em>(Freeze)</em></p>
